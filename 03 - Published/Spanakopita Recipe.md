# Spanakopita Recipe

*When you have 1.25 pounds of farm-fresh spinach and a craving for something truly special*

After diving deep into traditional Greek recipes and modern techniques, I’ve created what I believe is the perfect spanakopita—crispy, flaky phyllo encasing a rich, herb-laden filling that celebrates both authenticity and practicality.

## Why This Recipe Works

This isn’t just another spanakopita recipe. I’ve synthesized the best elements from traditional Greek cooks and modern food science to create something that delivers on every level:

- **Perfect moisture balance**: The key insight that separates soggy spanakopita from perfect spanakopita
- **Layered flavors**: Fresh herbs, quality feta, and aromatics that build complexity
- **Foolproof phyllo technique**: No more anxiety about working with delicate pastry
- **Make-ahead friendly**: Because life is busy and good food shouldn’t be stressful

## Ingredients

### The Filling

- 1.25 lbs **fresh spinach**, coarsely chopped
- 12 oz **block feta cheese**, crumbled (don’t use pre-crumbled!)
- 8 oz **whole milk ricotta cheese**
- 4 large **eggs**, lightly beaten
- 1 large **yellow onion**, finely chopped
- 4-5 **scallions**, thinly sliced
- 3 **garlic cloves**, minced
- 1/4 cup **fresh dill**, chopped
- 1/4 cup **fresh flat-leaf parsley**, chopped
- 1/4 cup **extra-virgin olive oil**
- 1/4 tsp **freshly grated nutmeg**
- **Kosher salt** and **black pepper** to taste
- **Zest of 1/2 lemon** (optional but recommended)

### The Phyllo

- 1 lb package **phyllo dough**, thawed
- 3/4 cup **extra-virgin olive oil**
- 4 tbsp **butter**, melted

## The Method

### Step 1: Master the Filling

The secret to great spanakopita isn’t in the phyllo—it’s in the filling. Here’s what I learned from the best recipes:

**Fresh Spinach Technique**: Wash your spinach thoroughly, then chop it coarsely. You want pieces that will hold their shape but cook evenly.

**The Aromatics**: Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet. Sauté the onion until translucent (about 5 minutes), then add garlic for 1 minute. Add spinach in batches, cooking until wilted and—this is crucial—until all moisture has evaporated.

**Cool and Combine**: Transfer to a large bowl and cool for 10 minutes. Add your crumbled feta (block feta has better texture and flavor), ricotta for creaminess, scallions, fresh herbs, nutmeg, lemon zest, and remaining olive oil. Season carefully—remember that feta is already salty.

**Final Touch**: Only after the mixture has cooled and you’ve adjusted the seasoning, add the beaten eggs and mix thoroughly.

### Step 2: Phyllo Without Fear

**Prep Work**: Preheat oven to 375°F. Mix your olive oil and melted butter in a bowl. Brush your 9x13-inch baking dish with this mixture.

**The Layering**: Place one phyllo sheet in the dish, letting excess hang over edges. Brush with oil mixture. Repeat with 7-8 sheets, brushing each layer. Don’t stress if phyllo tears—just keep going.

**Fill and Fold**: Spread your spinach mixture evenly. Fold the overhanging phyllo over the filling, brushing with oil mixture. Layer remaining phyllo on top, brushing each sheet and tucking edges into the pan.

**The Critical Step**: Score the top lightly with a sharp knife into serving pieces. This prevents cracking later.

### Step 3: The Perfect Bake

Start at 375°F for 20 minutes, then reduce to 350°F for 25-30 minutes until golden and crispy. The key is getting that initial high heat to start the phyllo crisping, then gentler heat to cook through without burning.

## Why This Version Is Different

After studying recipes from Mediterranean Dish, Serious Eats, Dimitra’s Dishes, and others, here’s what makes this version special:

1. **Ricotta Addition**: Provides creaminess without overwhelming the feta
2. **Fresh Herb Balance**: Dill and parsley in perfect proportion
3. **Proper Moisture Control**: Technique ensures no soggy bottom
4. **Forgiving Phyllo Method**: Less fussy than traditional layer-by-layer brushing
5. **Nutmeg Touch**: The subtle warmth that distinguishes good from great

## Pro Tips from My Recipe Research

- **Squeeze, then squeeze again**: Whether using fresh or frozen spinach, moisture is the enemy
- **Room temperature eggs**: They incorporate better and won’t shock your cooled filling
- **Quality matters**: Block feta over pre-crumbled, fresh herbs over dried when possible
- **The overnight trick**: Can be assembled and refrigerated overnight, then baked the next day

## Serving and Storage

Serve warm or at room temperature. It’s excellent with a simple Greek salad, some good olive oil, and maybe a glass of crisp white wine.

Leftovers keep for 3 days refrigerated and actually reheat beautifully in a 350°F oven for 10-15 minutes.
